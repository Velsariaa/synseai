BPI (Bank of the Philippine Islands) is the oldest bank in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, founded in 1851 as El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II. It played an early role in financing the Philippine Treasury and printing the first Philippine currency called “pesos fuertes.” In 1982, BPI officially became a universal bank, expanding its services to include consumer and corporate banking, lending, asset management, insurance, brokerage, leasing, and investment banking.

Ayala Corporation became the dominant shareholder in 1969, and BPI became its flagship financial institution. Over the decades, BPI grew through acquisitions of other banks and financial institutions, including People’s Bank and Trust Co. (1974), Commercial Bank and Trust (1981), CityTrust Banking (1996), Far East Bank and Trust (2000), Prudential Bank (2005), BPI Family Savings Bank (merged in 2022), and Robinsons Bank (merged in 2024).

BPI has been a pioneer in banking innovations in the Philippines. It introduced the first ATM network in 1981, the first debit-card system in 1987, telephone banking, and the Express Banking Centers in the 1990s. It established Expressnet in 1986, an interbank ATM network, and the Express Payment System (EPS) for point-of-sale transactions.

In the 2020s, BPI emphasized digitalization, customer obsession, and sustainability. It invested around 9 billion pesos in technology in 2021, improving platforms such as BPI Online, BPI Mobile, BPI Trade, BanKo, and BizLink. Nearly 4.9 million of its 8.46 million customers adopted digital banking services by 2022. Its OneBPI program merged its thrift bank operations into the main BPI structure to simplify services.

BPI has a sustainability strategy called ESG+E (environmental, social, governance plus economic growth). It pledged to cut coal financing in half by 2026 and fully phase it out by 2032. Through BPI Foundation, the bank also supports financial education, livelihood, environment, arts, and disaster response initiatives.

The bank’s head office is located at Ayala Triangle Gardens Tower 2, Makati. It operates more than 1,100 branches and over 2,700 ATMs and cash machines nationwide. It also has international operations through BPI International Finance in Hong Kong and BPI Europe PLC in London, with remittance offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Dubai.

BPI is the third largest universal bank in the Philippines by assets, with over 3.2 trillion pesos in assets as of 2025. By 2022, it reported revenues of 118.5 billion pesos, net income of 39.6 billion pesos, total assets of 2.6 trillion pesos, and a workforce of around 18,200 employees, two-thirds of whom are women.

BPI’s current headquarters on Ayala Avenue, built in 1982, is being replaced by a new 45-storey, eco-friendly tower with 89,000 square meters of floor space, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill with Aidea Philippines and developed by Ayala Land. Construction began in March 2022, with completion expected in 2029 and operations by 2030.

BPI (Bank of the Philippine Islands) is the oldest bank in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, founded in 1851 as El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II. It was the first to issue paper money in the country and later evolved into a universal bank in 1982, offering consumer banking, corporate lending, asset management, insurance, brokerage, leasing, payments, and investment banking.

Ayala Corporation became the major shareholder in 1969, and BPI became its flagship financial entity. Growth was driven by acquisitions including People’s Bank and Trust Co. (1974), Commercial Bank and Trust (1981), CityTrust Banking (1996), Far East Bank and Trust (2000), Prudential Bank (2005), BPI Family Savings Bank (merged in 2022), and Robinsons Bank (merged in 2024).

BPI has pioneered several innovations in Philippine banking. It introduced the country’s first ATM network in 1981, the first debit card system in 1987, and telephone and kiosk banking in the 1990s. It also established Expressnet, the first interbank ATM network, and launched the Express Payment System for POS transactions.

Recent years have focused on digital transformation, sustainability, and financial inclusion. In 2021, BPI invested around 9 billion pesos in technology, improving platforms like BPI Online, BPI Mobile, BPI Trade, BanKo, and BizLink. By 2022, nearly 4.9 million of its 8.46 million customers had adopted digital banking. BPI also launched the OneBPI integration to unify its services under one structure.

Sustainability is a central focus. BPI introduced the ESG+E framework (environment, social, governance plus economic growth), committed to halving coal financing by 2026 and phasing it out by 2032. In 2023, BPI secured a US 250 million dollar green bond investment from the International Finance Corporation to support renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and climate-smart agriculture. In 2024, it issued 33.7 billion pesos in SEED bonds to finance social and environmental projects and partnered with climate fintech Helios to launch a “solar mortgage,” allowing homeowners to finance solar panels through housing loans.

BPI has expanded its digital ecosystem through open banking partnerships. It has connected with over 126 partners in e-commerce, fintech, payments, remittances, insurance, and logistics, including PayMongo, Seabank, UNOBank, Entrego, and Philstocks. Customers can also access BPI services through Agency Banking outlets and even a BPI “store” on Lazada for account opening, card applications, and loans.

Financial inclusion is driven by its microfinance arm BanKo, which released 21.7 billion pesos in new loans in 2024, a 45 percent growth from the previous year. The BanKo app gained 500,000 new users in 2024. BanKo also partnered with ECPay, expanding access to 300,000 payment outlets nationwide.

Digital platforms remain central to growth. By 2024, BPI had around 7 million mobile app enrollees and 4.2 million active users across its platforms, including BPI App, VYBE wallet, BPI Trade, BPI Wealth Online, BanKo App, and BPI BizLink. Its lifestyle wallet, VYBE, integrates rewards and spending tools, while its upgraded mobile app has been adopted by 6.6 million users, with 70 percent active usage. BPI also added AI-powered personal finance tools in partnership with Personetics, offering hyper-personalized recommendations under the “Track and Plan” feature.

BPI is also investing in physical-digital or “phygital” branch expansion. By 2025, it plans to operate about 780 branches nationwide, with around 140 phygital branches blending self-service digital tools with in-person advisory support.

As of 2025, BPI is the third largest bank in the Philippines by assets, holding over 3.2 trillion pesos. In 2022, it reported 118.5 billion pesos in revenues, 39.6 billion pesos net income, and employed about 18,200 people, with 67 percent women.

Its head office is currently at Ayala Triangle Gardens Tower 2 in Makati. Its 1982 headquarters on Ayala Avenue is being redeveloped into a new 45-storey eco-friendly tower designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with completion expected by 2029 and operations by 2030.
